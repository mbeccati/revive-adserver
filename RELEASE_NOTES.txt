Release Notes: Revive Adserver 4.1.0
====================================

These release notes cover what's new, system requirements, download and
installation instructions, known issues and frequently asked questions for
Revive Adserver. Please read these notes before reporting any bugs.


What's New in Revive Adserver 4.1.0
-----------------------------------

 * Release date: TBA

 Security Updates
 ----------------

 * None

 New Features
 ------------

 * Added new optional feature to block:
     - the logging of impressions;
     - the logging of clicks; and
     - the re-direction of the browser to the target page
   when the the logging script/click script of an inactive banner
   is accessed. This feature is enabled by default for new installations, but
   users upgrading will need to enable the feature as an administrator user
   under the Configuration > Global Settings > Banner Logging Settings section.

 * Updated the pages under the Statistics tab to all be called "Statistics" 
   pages in the UI, instead of (in some places), "History" pages.

 * Invocation tags are now generated with a much shorter comment, and, by
   default, no longer include the large block of comments in the tag. (The
   comments can be switched on for a given tag, if required, during tag
   generation.)

 * In the user interface, a number of terms have been renamed, to bring the
   language used into line with modern terms:

     * ACLs are now Delivery Options;

     * Delivery Limitations are now Delivery Rules;

     * Targeting Channels are now Delivery Rule Sets.

 * New Site Delivery Rules added to the core Delivery Rules plugin to allow
   whitelist/blacklist delivery based on hostnames or registerable domain
   names.

 * Added new security feature to invalidate all the active sessions of the
   current user when changing or recovering the password.

 * Added the option to use TinyMCE as a WYSIWYG HTML editor when creating and
   editing HTML banners. The editor is switched off by default, for
   increased backwards compatibility, but it can be enabled by default via
   the user interface account preferences. This preference is ignored when
   editing HTML ads containing scripts or iframes in order to avoid
   inadvertently altering 3rd party tags.

 * Added a new {img_url_prefix} magic macro that will print the configured
   http/https images URL during delivery, depending on the calling protocol.

 * Added (beta) support for HTML5 banners, allowing the upload of banners in
   IAB compliant ZIP file formats.

 * Added automatic switch to the mysqli driver when mysql is selected as the
   database type in the configuration file, but the mysql extension is not
   available (and vice versa).

 * Added support for ordering advertisers, campaigns, banners, websites and
   zones by the date each was last updated on the main index page for each, to
   make finding recently updated entities easier in large installations.

 Bug Fixes
 ---------

 * Fixed display of shortcuts to advertisers, campaigns, banners, websites,
   zones, etc. on the statistics pages.

 * Added missing check for access to the required PHP scandir() function in the
   pre-initialisation system.

 * Fixed invalid PHP comment in the local mode invocation tags.

 * Fixed incompatibility with "N;M;/path" syntax in session.save_path detection
   during installation.

 * Fixed incompatibility with PHP 7.1+ during delivery of Video Ads.

 * Fixed an issue with Google AdSense and Yahoo! 3rd party tag click tracking
   options still available when upgrading from a previous version even though
   they had been removed from the plugin.

 * Fixed incompatibility with MySQL 8 (MariaDB 10.2, etc.), as "window" has
   become a reserved word, but wasn't properly quoted as identifier during
   maintenance when using conversions.

 * Added missing check for the json PHP extension during install/upgrade.

 Non-Backwards Compatible Changes
 --------------------------------

 * Support for PHP 5.5 has been dropped and Revive Adserver now requires at
   least PHP 5.6.0.

Known Issues
------------

This list covers some of the known problems with Revive Adserver. Please read
this before reporting any new bugs.

 * The upgrade process may time out with very large databases. See
   https://www.revive-adserver.com/docs/faq for more information if you
   have a large database.

 * If you want to run Revive Adserver with MySQL, please note that MySQL 4.1 or
   higher is required. If you are using an older version of MySQL, you will
   need to update you database software before upgrading.

 * If you want to run Revive Adserver with PostgreSQL, please note that
   PostgreSQL 8.1 or higher is required. If you are using an older version of
   PostgreSQL, you will need to update your database software before
   upgrading.

 * Some of the PEAR libraries used are not compatible with database prefix
   names with double "_" characters (e.g. "rv__"). You should NOT install
   Revive Adserver with a prefix of this format.

 * Some users have reported issues of being logged out when viewing
   statistics. This can be worked around by ensuring that the timezone is
   correctly set in PHP.
